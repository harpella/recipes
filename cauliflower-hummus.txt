Serves: 2½ cups
Ingredients
24oz cauliflower florets
3 tsp olive oil
½ tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp garlic powder

½ tsp cumin
½ tsp salt
⅓ cup tahini (you can use more or less to taste)
¼-1/3 cup lemon juice (SEE NOTE)
1 small clove of garlic
Salt to taste

Pomegranate molasses
Olive oil
Dukkah
Instructions
Preheat oven to 400F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper
In a large bowl, combine cauliflower florets, olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic and onion powder, cumin and salt. Toss well so the florets are well coated. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes until tender. Let them cool slightly
Combine roasted cauliflower, tahini, lemon juice, garlic and salt in a food processor and pulse until creamy and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve
Top with your favorite garnishes
Notes
Start with ¼ cup of lemon juice and add more to taste. Because we like it on the sour side, we added a whole ⅓ of a cup
